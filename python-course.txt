OOP is a powerful programming paradigm that allows you to structure your code in a more organized, reusable, and maintainable way. It revolves around the concepts of *classes* and *objects*.\n\n**1. What is Object-Oriented Programming?**\n\n*   A programming paradigm based on \"objects,\" which contain data (attributes) and code (methods) that operate on that data.\n*   Key principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction (we'll touch on these briefly now and dive deeper in later modules).\n*   Benefits:\n    *   Improved code organization and modularity.\n    *   Increased code reusability.\n    *   Easier maintenance and debugging.\n    *   Modeling real-world entities more naturally.\n\n**2. Classes: Blueprints for Objects**\n\n*   A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.  It defines the attributes (data) and methods (behavior) that objects of that class will have.\n*   Think of a class like a blueprint for a house.  The blueprint describes the house's structure, rooms, and features, but it's not the actual house itself.\n*   Syntax for defining a class:\n\n```python\nclass ClassName:\n    # Class attributes (variables)\n    # Methods (functions)\n    pass # \"pass\" is a placeholder if you haven't defined anything yet\n```\n\n*   **`class` keyword:**  Indicates the start of a class definition.\n*   **`ClassName`:** The name of the class (use PascalCase/CamelCase convention – e.g., `MyClass`).\n*   **Indentation:** All code within the class must be indented.\n*   **`pass` statement:**  A placeholder when you don't want to define anything in the class yet.  It prevents a syntax error.\n\n**3. Objects: Instances of Classes**\n\n*   An object is a specific instance of a class.  It's a concrete realization of the blueprint.\n*   Think of an object as an actual house built from the blueprint. You can have multiple houses (objects) built from the same blueprint (class).\n*   Creating an object (instantiation):\n\n```python\nobject_name = ClassName() # Calling the class as if it were a function\n```\n\n*   `object_name` now holds a reference to a new object of type `ClassName`.\n\n**4. Attributes: Object Data**\n\n*   Attributes are variables that hold data associated with an object. They describe the object's state.\n*   Attributes are defined *within* the class, typically inside a special method called the `__init__` method (the constructor).\n\n**5. Methods: Object Behavior**\n\n*   Methods are functions defined within a class that operate on the object's data (attributes). They define what the object *can do*.\n*   Methods always take `self` as the first parameter. `self` refers to the object instance itself.\n\n**6. The `__init__` Method (Constructor)**\n\n*   A special method that is automatically called when an object of the class is created (instantiated).\n*   Used to initialize the object's attributes with specific values.\n*   The `self` parameter refers to the object being created.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```python\nclass Dog:\n    def __init__(self, name, breed, age):\n        self.name = name       # Attributes: name, breed, age\n        self.breed = breed\n        self.age = age\n\n    def bark(self):\n        print(\"Woof!\")\n\n    def describe(self):\n        print(f\"This is {self.name}, a {self.age}-year-old {self.breed}.\")\n\n\n# Creating Dog objects\nmy_dog = Dog(\"Buddy\", \"Golden Retriever\", 3)\nyour_dog = Dog(\"Lucy\", \"Poodle\", 5)\n\n# Accessing attributes\nprint(my_dog.name)      # Output: Buddy\nprint(your_dog.breed)    # Output: Poodle\n\n# Calling methods\nmy_dog.bark()          # Output: Woof!\nyour_dog.describe()    # Output: This is Lucy, a 5-year-old Poodle.\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **`class Dog:`**: Defines a class named `Dog`.\n*   **`__init__(self, name, breed, age)`**:  The constructor. It takes the object itself (`self`) and the name, breed, and age as arguments.\n*   **`self.name = name`**:  Assigns the value of the `name` argument to the `name` attribute of the object.  Same for `breed` and `age`.\n*   **`bark(self)`**: A method that prints \"Woof!\".  It doesn't need any arguments other than `self`.\n*   **`describe(self)`**: A method that prints a description of the dog using its attributes.\n*   **`my_dog = Dog(\"Buddy\", \"Golden Retriever\", 3)`**: Creates a `Dog` object named `my_dog` and initializes its attributes.\n*   **`print(my_dog.name)`**: Accesses the `name` attribute of the `my_dog` object using dot notation (`object.attribute`).\n*   **`my_dog.bark()`**: Calls the `bark()` method of the `my_dog` object.\n\n**7.  `self` Keyword: The Key to Object Access**\n\n*   `self` is a reference to the *instance* of the class (the object) within the class's methods.\n*   It allows you to access the object's attributes and call its other methods from within the class.\n*   Every method in a class must have `self` as the first parameter.\n\n**8. Practice Exercises:**\n\n1.  Create a `Car` class with attributes like `make`, `model`, `year`, and `color`.  Include methods to `start_engine()`, `stop_engine()`, and `get_info()` (which prints the car's information).  Create two `Car` objects and call their methods.\n2.  Create a `Rectangle` class with attributes `width` and `height`. Include methods to calculate the `area()` and `perimeter()`. Create a `Rectangle` object and calculate its area and perimeter.\n3.  Create a `BankAccount` class with attributes `account_number` and `balance`. Include methods to `deposit(amount)` and `withdraw(amount)`.  Add a check to ensure the withdrawal amount doesn't exceed the balance. Create a `BankAccount` object, deposit some money, and then withdraw some.\n\n**9.

In future modules, we'll explore:\n\n*   Inheritance\n*   Polymorphism\n*   Encapsulation\n*   Class attributes vs. instance attributes\n*   More advanced method types (e.g., static methods, class methods)\n"},{"Heading":"Module 9","Content":"- Heading: \"Module 9: Working with Databases in Python\"\n- Content: \"This module introduces database interaction using Python.
